This test will perform default Foreman installation.

It's called `fb-install-foreman.bats`, the following environment variables can
be specified:

* `FOREMAN_REPO`: directory name under yum.tf.org (e.g. /releases/1.3, nightly),
  or component under deb.tf.org (1.3, nightly) to use as Foreman repo
* `FOREMAN_CUSTOM_URL`: custom repo URL to configure, overrides use of
  `FOREMAN_REPO` for the main Foreman URL
* `MODULE_PATH`: override the location of modules used for installation
* `FOREMAN_USE_ORGANIZATIONS`: whether to use organizations or not (value can be true/false)
* `FOREMAN_USE_LOCATIONS`: whether to use locations or not (value can be true/false).

*PuppetLabs Puppet installation test*

It installs PuppetLabs Puppet and it is called `fb-install-plpuppet.bats`, the
following environment variables can be specified:

* `PUPPET_REPO`: either "nightly" or "stable" (default)

*Foreman Hammer CLI smoke test*

Checkouts and executes hammer integration tests. They will create new
(randomly named) organization and populate various fields, then delete
everything.

It's called `fb-hammer-tests.bats`.  The following environment variables can
be specified:

* `HAMMER_TEST_PATH`: /usr/share/hammer-tests by default, if exists will be
  used instead of the git checkout
* `HAMMER_TEST_REPO`: path to the hemmer tests' github repo, default is https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-tests.git
* `HAMMER_TEST_BRANCH`: branch to checkout, default is master

perform basic rbovirt integration test. It requires hardware with
virtualization support, works fine in nested KVM as well. It accepts the
following parameters:

* `OVIRT_RELEASE`: version to install specified as simple number (33, 34, 35)

Vagrant support
---------------

A Vagrantfile is supplied with multi-OS support.  This will transfer
foreman-bats to the VM and tests can then be executed via `vagrant ssh`:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh -c 'sudo /vagrant/fb-install-foreman.bats'
       # or...
    vagrant up wheezy
    vagrant ssh wheezy -c 'sudo /vagrant/fb-install-foreman.bats'

It is also possible to test a different set of modules on all supported
platforms:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer local
    vagrant up
    for vm in precise squeeze wheezy f19 el6 ; do
        vagrant ssh $vm -c 'sudo MODULE_PATH=/vagrant/local/modules /vagrant/fb-install-foreman.bats'
    done

Koji support
------------

It is possible to execute BATS suite that configures local repository
containing a build specified by URL of a Koji/Brew instance. The repository
has higher priority and therefore builds will be picked up. This is great for
testing installer or any other packages that needs to be installed in early
stage. Example:

    export KOJI_BUILD="http://koji.katello.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=97092"
    fb-setup-koji.bats
    fb-install-foreman.bats

Just make sure the URL points to a "leaf" task, a page with (S)RPMs and not
parent task.
