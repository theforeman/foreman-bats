There is also a helper script that automates git installation and installation
of BATS and Foreman BATS:

    curl --silent https://raw.github.com/lzap/foreman-bats/master/bootstrap.sh | bash /dev/stdin

A Vagrantfile is supplied with multi-OS support.  This will transfer
foreman-bats to the VM and tests can then be executed via `vagrant ssh`:

    vagrant up
       # or...
    os=wheezy vagrant up
    vagrant ssh -c 'sudo /usr/local/bin/fb-install-foreman.bats'

When using fb-install-foreman.bats, the following environment variables can be
specified:

* FOREMAN_REPO: directory name under yum.tf.org (e.g. /releases/1.3, nightly),
  or component under deb.tf.org (1.3, nightly) to use as Foreman repo
* FOREMAN_CUSTOM_URL: custom repo URL to configure, overrides use of
  FOREMAN_REPO for the main Foreman URL
